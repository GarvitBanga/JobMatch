## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS NOW**

### **Example: Amazon Jobs Search Page**

1. **Visit:** https://www.amazon.jobs/en/search?base_query=software+engineer
2. **Click:** Extension "Scan This Page" button
3. **System Processing:**
   ```
   🔍 Found 47 job links on page
   📦 Processing top 25 jobs in 5 batches of 5
   🌐 Cross-origin fetch: amazon.jobs/job/12345
   ✅ Extracted: "Software Development Engineer - AWS"
   🤖 Batch OpenAI analysis: 25 jobs → Single API call
   🎯 Result: 18 matches with AI insights
   ```

### **Sample AI Analysis Result:**
```json
{
  "title": "Software Development Engineer - AWS Lambda",
  "match_score": 94,
  "matching_skills": ["Python", "AWS", "Distributed Systems"],
  "missing_skills": ["Kubernetes", "Go"],
  "ai_analysis": "Excellent match! Your Python and AWS experience directly aligns with Lambda development. Consider learning Kubernetes for infrastructure roles.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "rank": 1
}
```

## 💰 **COST COMPARISON - DRAMATIC SAVINGS**

### **Old Approach (Individual Calls):**
```
Amazon search: 25 jobs
→ 25 OpenAI API calls
→ 25 × $0.02 = $0.50 per scan
→ Hits rate limits quickly
```

### **New Approach (Batch Processing):**
```
Amazon search: 25 jobs
→ 1 OpenAI API call (all jobs together)
→ 1 × $0.02 = $0.02 per scan
→ 96% cost reduction!
```

**Real Cost Example:**
- **100 job scans per month**
- **Old cost:** $50/month
- **New cost:** $2/month
- **Savings:** $48/month (96% reduction)
