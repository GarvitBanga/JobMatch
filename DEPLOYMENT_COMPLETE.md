---

## 🛠️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Enhanced Content Script Flow:**
```
1. 🔍 Find job links on page
2. 🤔 Check if same-origin or cross-origin
3. 🟢 Same-origin → Direct fetch
4. 🟡 Cross-origin → Backend API fetch
5. ✅ Return full job descriptions (no more placeholder text!)
```

### **Backend API Capabilities:**
- **Site Detection:** Automatically identifies Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Amazon, etc.
- **Smart Extraction:** Uses site-specific selectors for optimal results
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks when extraction fails
- **Real Headers:** Bypasses bot detection with realistic browser headers

---

## 📁 **Key Files Modified/Created**

### **Backend:**
- ✅ `main_simple.py` - Enhanced with cross-origin job fetching
- ✅ API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/fetch/job`

### **Frontend:**
- ✅ `extension/public/content-enhanced.js` - Smart routing for job fetching
- ✅ `extension/public/manifest.json` - Updated to use enhanced script

### **Testing:**

- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_AND_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Complete testing instructions
