# 🧠 LLM-Enhanced Resume Processing Workflow

## 📋 Overview

The Bulk-Scanner Resume Matcher now features **AI-powered career intelligence** using OpenAI's LLM technology. This enhancement transforms the system from basic text matching to sophisticated career analysis and personalized job recommendations.

## 🔄 Complete Processing Pipeline

### 1. **Resume Upload & Text Extraction**
```
User uploads PDF/DOCX/TXT → Backend extracts raw text → LLM processes content
```

**File Types Supported:**
- PDF (using PyPDF2 + pdfplumber)
- DOCX (using python-docx)
- TXT (direct text processing)

**Processing Methods:**
- **Primary**: pdfplumber (better for complex layouts)
- **Fallback**: PyPDF2 (when pdfplumber fails)
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with detailed error messages

### 2. **LLM-Powered Resume Structuring**
```
Raw Text → OpenAI API → Structured JSON → Enhanced with Career Insights
```

**Structured Data Output:**
```json
{
  "personal_info": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com", 
    "phone": "+1-555-0123",
